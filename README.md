# Lost in Translation

Lost in Translation is a React framework specific frontend project, that uses API for saving user information, React Router to navigate between pages and Redux for state management. Bootstrap is used for UI layout.

Page is running on Heroku: xxx

Assignment was made as a pair project of Sergei Kaukiainen and Peppi Mäkelä, and it was the sixth weekly assignment of Experis Academy.

## Functionalities
### Login

User can enter their username and login to the website. If username doesn't exist in the API, new user will be created. If username already exists, the user information will be loaded.

User can't enter to the website without login. When login is successful, user will be redirected to the translation page and can't enter to the login page again before logout.

### Translation

User can type text they want to translate (max 40 characters) to the input field, and the translation will be shown below it. The input will be saved automatically to the API. 

User can enter to this page only if they are currently logged in.

### Profile

At profile page the users last 10 translations will be shown as a list. User can delete translations from the list, but the translations remain saved at the API. 

User can logout at the profile page to enter back to the login page. User can enter to this page only if they are currently logged in.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
